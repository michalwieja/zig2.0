This plugin allows you to manage columns under the users page in the WordPress admin area.

== Description ==

“Manage User Columns” is a small plugin that allows you to manage the user fields displayed on the users list page in the WordPress dashboard area.
The new fields will be added as columns with other user information. All new columns will be sortable.

You can add default user fields like registration-date, custom fields added by other plugins or custom code, and remove any default or custom field from the Users list table.
Removing columns will not delete any user data. So, you are safe to toggle between these columns.

This plugin adds a new column "Registration Date" as a default column which you can enable/disable easily.
